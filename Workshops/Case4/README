This case is actually a do it yourself (DIY). We explained during the event why it could not be replicated to get you guys something to play with. There are so many dynamics that we do not have control over, but if you walk through the steps, you will be able to create the same environment we want you to test and play with. It is a great learning experience, please make sure you do it.

As always, feel free to reach out to us, we are all available on Twitter or could be contacted by email.

Thank you!
